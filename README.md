## Feeling hungry?
Welcome to Eating w Eyes, a recipe-sharing website! Our platform is designed for food lovers who enjoy cooking and want to share their favorite recipes. You can upload your recipes and share them with our community. 

Not only can you share your recipes, you can also explore other recipes that have been shared on the website. 


## How did it start?
The project started on 21.04.23 [Project Planning](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMReNcn4=/?share_link_id=781679698877). 

The link attached provides all the planning prior to starting the project from planning models and branding to creating seed data.
